\subsection{Process Investigation and Selection}
\label{ssec:processselection}

\Cref{tab:fomman} shows our figures of merit for our manufacturing technique decision matrices.  Note that we prioritized in a similar fashion to our design figures with some changes to more applicable figures.  First, again, is weight.  The lower the aircraft weight, the more points can be had through {\color{\BYUred} {\color{BYUred} [YEAR SPECIFIC ITEM]}}.  After weight, we prioritized strength, as our structures need to be able to carry the loads required.  Third is simplicity; we need to be able to actually manufacture something with a given technique.  Note that simplicity is relative to our team's expertise at the time of our decisions and feasible future abilities within the time frame of the competition.  We next chose to include durability.  It is not very high on our list since we would hope to be able to design an aircraft that has no unscheduled landings, however, one cannot predict the future enough to know whether or not durability will be required, and experience shows that it most likely will.  Finally, {\color{\BYUred}[TALK ABOUT THE YEAR SPECIFIC METRIC IF THERE IS ONE.]} Because many of these factors depend on intelligent design (e.g. a built-up balsa wing could be heavier than a foam core wing, depending on how it is designed), as well as manufacturer skill, we did some prototyping and testing of representative models before completing our decision factor calculations.

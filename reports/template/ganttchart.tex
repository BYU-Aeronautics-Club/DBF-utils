	\caption{This milestone chart shows our plan for major elements of our design process. Note that at the time of submitting this proposal, we have completed the conceptual design presented herein and have moved on to our preliminary design phase. Also note that we will begin prototyping early in order to apply a ``fail fast, fail often'' methodology to quickly fill the gaps in understanding and allow our underclassmen to develop their aircraft design intuition faster than if we waited to prototype after completing the design phases.}

\subsection{Mission Requirements Decomposition}
\label{ssec:MissionReqs}

We have organized our sub-system requirements into aerodynamics, structure, propulsion, and specialty requirements explained below.

\subsubsection{Aerodynamics Requirements}
\label{sssec:AerodynamicReqs}

Some of the major requirements for the aerodynamics sub-system are: Maximize aerodynamic efficiency in order to use less energy to overcome drag for all flight missions.  Design wing loading to be able to take off and fly with design max payload weight.  Keep the wingspan within the maximum of {\color{BYUred}[MAX SPAN CONSTRAINT THIS YEAR]}.  Choose airfoil(s) and configuration that will make take off feasible in the {\color{BYUred}[THIS YEAR'S TAKE-OFF REQUIREMENT]}

\subsubsection{Structural Requirements}
\label{sssec:StructuralReqs}

The breakdown of mission requirements for the structures sub-system include: Minimize the structural weight while maintaining sufficient rigidity to keep the aerodynamics as designed, especially when full payload weight is in use.  Make sure the structure is sufficiently rigid to avoid aerodynamic flutter within the flight envelope. {\color{BYUred}[OTHER MISC. STRUCTURES REQUIREMENTS THIS YEAR (E.G. FOLDING WINGS.)]}

\subsubsection{Propulsion Requirements}
\label{sssec:PropulsionReqs}

The propulsion sub-system requirements are to: Have sufficient system efficiency and battery capacity to enable completion of the flight missions and maximizing speed with sufficient endurance while also providing sufficient thrust for {\color{BYUred}[THIS YEAR'S TAKE-OFF REQUIREMENT]}

\subsubsection{Specialty Requirements} %change this to be specifically what it is (like bomb drop or whatever the specific mission is)

%Preliminary design / sizing results

After making some decisions about the overall configuration of our aircraft (details on our decision process will be included in the Design Report), we arrived at the configuration seen in \cref{fig:prelimdrawings}.
{\color{BYUred}[COMMENT ON MAJOR FEATURES OF THE CONFIGURATION, GIVE SOME BASIC JUSTIFICATION, LIKE "WE CHOSE THIS BECAUSE IT WOULD WORK WELL FOR THIS REQUIREMENT"]}

Using common hand calculation level formulas, we arrived at a conceptual design with the following specifications: a wing span of {\color{BYUred} [X.X ft]}, aspect ratio of {\color{BYUred} [X.X]}, wing loading of {\color{BYUred} [X.X lbs/ft$^2$]}, horizontal and vertical tail volume ratios of {\color{BYUred} [X.X]} and {\color{BYUred} [X.X]} respectively, stall velocity of {\color{BYUred} [X.X ft/sec]}, and take-off distance of {\color{BYUred} [X.X ft]}.  {\color{BYUred}[INCLUDE ANY OTHER PERTINENT PARAMETERS HERE AS WELL!]}

\subsection{Sensitivity Study}
\label{ssec:SensitivityStudy}
%Sensitivity Study of Design Parameters.  This isn't just some linear plots of the ways to obtain points.  It's a sensitivity study of how the \textit{DESIGN PARAMETERS} relate to obtaining points. For example, how does weight affect the endurance and therefore number of laps that can be flown?
%In the code directory in the repository you found this template there is a sensitivity.jl code that produces the plot used here.

		}
	\caption{This plot shows the effects of those design parameters that directly affect the increase/decrease in mission scoring beyond simple completion.}
	\label{fig:sensitivity}
\end{wrapfigure}

For our sensitivity study, we first differentiated between design variables that could increase/decrease our score and those that were only related to the minimum constraints. Based on the scoring metrics, we found the parameters that could affect the score to be: wing area, aircraft weight (including batteries), zero-lift parasitic drag coefficient, {\color{BYUred}[WHICHEVER PAYLOAD ITEMS ARE IMPORTANT]}, and available power.  To perform our study, we took our basic parameters and ran them through common hand calculations to find the mission objective scores. In order to normalize the scores as they are in the competition, we ran the analysis first without normalization, from which we saved the maximum scores like they are in competition. We then used those maxima as the normalization factors and re-ran the analysis, thus making sure all the sensitivities had the same order of magnitude.  In our analysis (results shown in \cref{fig:sensitivity}), we found that the wing area and parasitic drag coefficient had the same sensitivities, thus we want to minimize drag and maximize wing loading (while still being able to take off).  The available power was also important, and can be affected by increasing battery capacity, discharge rate, or voltage, or increasing system efficiency. {\color{BYUred}[TAKE AWAYS FROM PAYLOAD STUFF]}. We should also note that the aircraft weight had a negligible effect on the overall sensitivity, but is important to keep in mind when designing for a feasible aircraft.

Our manufacturing flow follows the outline found in \cref{fig:plannedtiming} which includes three design-build-fly phases.  \Cref{fig:manufacturingplan} shows this flow with more clarity.  Note that for all phases, CAD will commence roughly a week after design starts, prototyping a week after that.

\subsubsection{Phase 1} We began with a conceptual design along with conceptual CAD, from which we have built concept prototypes to be used in testing as described below. {\color{BYUred}[ADD A DETAIL ABOUT MATERIALS AND/OR PROCESSES.]}

\subsubsection{Phase 2} We are currently beginning our preliminary design and CAD from which we will build preliminary prototypes for testing. {\color{BYUred}[ADD A DETAIL ABOUT MATERIALS AND/OR PROCESSES.]}

\subsubsection{Phase 3} Around the new year, we will start on our detailed design and CAD, which will lead to our final testing prototypes.  After polishing the design and CAD after final testing, we will manufacture our final competition aircraft. {\color{BYUred}[ADD A DETAIL ABOUT MATERIALS AND/OR PROCESSES.]}

\label{sec:TestingPlan}
% Section Requirements:
% 1) Component and ground test plan
% 2) Flight test plan 

As mentioned in \cref{ssec:ManufacturingFlow} and shown in \cref{fig:plannedtiming}, each of our design and build iterations culminate in testing.  Testing is divided into two categories as follows:
{\color{BYUred}[NEED TO FLESH OUT DETAILS BELOW BASED ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE COMPETITION AND YOUR CONCEPTUAL DESIGN.]}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%% - Ground Testing - %%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Component/Ground Test Plan}
\label{ssec:GroundTestingPlan}

For all phases, ground testing will start roughly a week after prototyping has commenced. 

\subsubsection{Phase 1} We began by testing a quick series of concept prototypes for our {\color{BYUred}[PAYLOAD, WING FOLDING MECHANISM, LAUNCH STATION, OR WHATEVER THEY ARE THIS YEAR]} in order to quickly narrow down our brainstorming to the most viable solutions.

\subsubsection{Phase 2} In our preliminary testing phase, we will be looking at functioning prototypes of {\color{BYUred}[PAYLOAD, WING FOLDING MECHANISM, LAUNCH STATION, OR WHATEVER THEY ARE THIS YEAR]} in order to nail down the major details of the design.  This will prepare us for integration in the next phase.  In this phase, we will also be begin performing preliminary wind tunnel testing to validate our propulsion system. In addition, we will perform preliminary structural testing of our anticipated wing and other critical structures.

\subsubsection{Phase 3} Finally, we will integrate all the components and do dry runs of the ground mission, as well as final wind tunnel and structural testing to validate our detailed computational analyses.





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%% - Flight Testing - %%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Flight Test Plan}
\label{ssec:FlightTestingPlan}

In all phases, flight tests will typically take place at the end of the phase, in the week following the termination of the prototyping.

\subsubsection{Phase 1} Flight testing began with our concept prototype: a hand-launched, unpowered, uncontrolled glider.  Our primary goals for the concept test were to validate our static stability and general structural calculations, as well as illuminate any gotchas we may have missed in our initial design phase.

\subsubsection{Phase 2} Our preliminary flight test prototype will be a powered, controlled aircraft, though without the full competition functionality.  Our goal for the preliminary test is to validate our preliminary designs before moving on to detailed design aspects and full system integration, as well as note any unexpected behavior in the aircraft dynamic responses. 

\subsubsection{Phase 3} Our detailed design prototype will be complete enough that if desired, we could compete without building another iteration. Our goal for the final testing phase will be to fly the complete mission sequence, allowing for any final fine-tuning of the design before building our competition aircraft.
